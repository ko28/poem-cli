Fade to Light                                                                                                           
By Cole Swensen                                                                                                                         

Hand me this hand
The sail is bent
The trail is sold
and the wind tied in knots

Answer the phone
The tune is left
The stones uncoil
in a wide-angle lens

A search for clues
encounters bliss
A lip on the edge
of the flowering dark

A shell falls with hail
Hidden...
```
